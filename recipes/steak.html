    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preferred cut of meat, I will be using a ribeye</li>
        <li>Olive oil or any high smoke point oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>Fresh thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Medium rare steak</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a skillet, optional but not necessary cast iron, heat up a tablespoon
            of olive oil over medium-high heat
        </li>
        <li>
            As the oil is heating up make sure you pat your steak dry with paper towels and
            season your steak generously with salt and pepper. Don't be afraid of overseasoning,
            the salt and pepper create that beautiful crust we all love.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the oil is hot sear your steak for about 3-4 minutes on each side to ensure you have
            a beautiful brown crust.
        </li>
        <li>
            To ensure the best results make sure you sear the edges as well for about 1-2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            After your steak is all seared, reduce the heat to medium and add your butter, garlic,
            and herbs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Baste your steak with the butter for about 3 minutes or until the steak is 10 degrees
            away from your desired temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove your steak and let it rest for about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice your steak into half inch pieces and serve!
        </li>
    </ol>
